# Lending Club Project

This project consists of the testing and evaluation of different algorithmic models with the aim of obtaining the most appropriate model for making decisions in the granting of a loan.

When a person applies for a loan, two decisions can be taken based on whether or not the candidate meets a series of requirements.

- Loan accepted: when the loan status is 'Fully Paid'.
- Loan rejected: when the loan status is 'Charged Off', 'Default', 'In Grace Period', 'Late (16-30 days)' or 'Late (31-120 days)'

In order to test the models, it was essential to carry out a cleaning and exploratory analysis of our data, as well as a feature engineering the data with which to train the predictive models.

The models used have been:
- Baseline Model and Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
